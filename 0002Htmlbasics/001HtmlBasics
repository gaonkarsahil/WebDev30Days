HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. 
It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.

Tags in HTML are case-insensitive. <h1> Sahil </H1> will work.
An element consist of opening tag , content and closing tag.
<tagname>Content</tagname>
The opening tag consists of less than symbol , tag name , greater than symbol.


Closing tags are optional (does not give error) but affects layout and design.
<H1>menu project<h1>gjvhjvvhj
output :- 
menu project
gjvhjvvhj


Nesting tags should be proper otherwise gives unexpected results.
<p> abc the <b>monster</b></p>
<p> abc the <b>monster</p></b>
<p> abc the <b>monster</b> villa</p>
<p> abc the <b>monster</p> villa</b>

output :- 
abc the monster
abc the monster
abc the monster villa
abc the monster
villa


Block-level elements :- appears on a new line, with space above and below. 
div, p , h1 , hr , ul , li , ol , form , table , main , nav , header , footer, aside , article , section.

<p>fourth</p><p>fifth</p><p>sixth</p>
output :- 
fourth
fifth
sixth


Inline elements :- sit on the same line, with no space in between.
a, b , br , button, em ,i , iframe ,img, input, script, sub, sup, video, span.

<em>first</em><em>second</em><em>third</em>
output :- 
firstsecondthird 


Empty / Void Elements :-  elements with no content.
br , hr , img, input , link , meta , param.


Attributes :- contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
Should have space between it and element name, attribute name followed by equal sign and attribute value wrapped with opening and closing quotes.
An anchor (<a>) can make the text it encloses into a hyperlink.
href:  web address for the link.
title: specifies extra information about the link, appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.
target: target="_blank" will display the link in a new tab.
<p>A link to my <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" title="The Mozilla homepage" target="_blank">favorite website</a>.</p>


Boolean attributes :- attributes written without values.
disabled attribute,wont allow user to make entries. The disabled elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.
<input type="text" disabled>
<input type="text">


Omitting quotes around attribute values will cause errors or unexpected behavior.
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>

<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>
the browser misinterprets the markup, mistaking the title attribute for three attributes:  a title attribute with the value The, and two Boolean attributes, Mozilla and homepage.


Both single and double quotes are equivalent. 
Don't mix single quotes and double quotes i.e dont start with one type and end with other type.
To use quote marks inside other quote marks of the same type (single quote or double quote), use HTML entities.
< ( &lt; ), >  ( &gt; ), “ ( &quot; ), ’ ( &apos; ), & ( &amp; ).



Anatomy of an HTML document

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
       <head>
    	<meta charset="utf-8">
    	<title>My test page</title>
       </head>
       <body>
    	<p>This is my page</p>
      </body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html> :- shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. Earlier doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML.
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.


<html></html> :-  wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.

<head></head> :- includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations. Not part of page content.

<meta charset="utf-8"> :-  UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages.With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain.

<title></title> :-  title of the page that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. Also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.

<body></body> :- contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.

Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program.
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>


Grouping HTML Elements
Used frequently to group various other HTML tags. (e.g :- div and span).

<div> tag
defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
block level tag which plays a big role in grouping various other HTML tags.
<div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
This tag does not provide any visual change on the block but this has more meaning when it is used with CSS.
    <body>
        <!-- First group -->
        <div style = "color:red">
            <h4>First group</h4>
            <p>Following is a list of red fruits</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Red Apple</li>
                <li>Red Strawberry</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Second group -->
        <div style = "color:green">
            <h4>Second group</h4>
            <p>Following is a list of green fruits</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Green Apple</li>
                <li>Green Strawberry</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>


<span> tag
an inline element and it can be used to group inline-elements in an HTML document.
This tag also does not provide any visual change on the block but has more meaning when it is used with CSS.
    <body>
        <p>This is <span style = "color:red">red</span> and this is
            <span style = "color:green">green</span>
        </p>
    </body>

The difference between the <span> tag and the <div> tag is that the <span> tag is used with inline elements whereas the <div> tag is used with block-level elements.
